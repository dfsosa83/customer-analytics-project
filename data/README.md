# Data Directory

This directory contains data files and outputs for the Customer Analytics Project.

## Directory Structure

### `/raw/`
Contains raw data files (if any) that are used as input to the analytics pipeline.
- Typically used for reference data or small datasets
- Snowflake is the primary data source, so this may be minimal

### `/processed/`
Contains processed and cached data files to improve performance.
- Query result caches
- Preprocessed datasets
- Intermediate analysis results

### `/exports/`
Contains exported data files generated by the application.
- CSV exports of customer-product relationships
- Analytics reports
- Data visualizations

## Data Sources

### Primary: Snowflake Database
- **Connection**: Configured via environment variables
- **Purpose**: Customer data, product data, transaction history
- **Access**: Via `SnowflakeService` in the application

### Secondary: Local Cache
- **Location**: `/processed/` directory
- **Purpose**: Performance optimization and offline development
- **Format**: JSON, Parquet, or CSV files

## File Naming Conventions

- Use ISO date format: `YYYY-MM-DD`
